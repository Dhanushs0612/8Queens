                <p>Vignesh Raja's debut movie Por Thozhil revolves around the story where 2 cops are on a mission to hunt down a serial killer.  This is a stereotypical theme, which Kollywood audience are used to from the days of Sigappu Rojakkal but the director has navigated through the plot with rich twists and tight screenplay, maintaining the suspense all through the movie.</p>

                <p>'Woman+ Unmarried+ Approaching one's 30s' is a perfect combination that would invite unabated sympathies and advise from one's friends(married) and family. Archana 31 Not Out portrays the life of one such woman, Archana(played by Aishwarya Lekshmi), who struggles to find the right groom for her. And when she eventually thinks she has found one, a twist awaits her. </p>

                <p>None likes facing crisis in life but we all know that it is inevitable though it's form and severity may vary. Some crisis could impact self while some like Covid 19 could impact people at large. Darwin's theory of evolution talks about survival of the fittest, which emphasizes on the adaptablity to the adverse situations as a quintessential quality to live to see another day. This theory is very much and all the more relevant in present scenario given the VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous) nature of the world. But what are the essential qualities, you may wonder. Thanks to the authors T N Hari and Sanjay Swami, who are eminent personalities in the entrepreneurial ecosystem in India, for they have shared their collective wisdom in the form of their book 'Sailing through a storm-Making crisis work for you', which helps us understand these qualities through the inspiring lives of men and women who had confronted major crisis, with equanimity and fortitude. All are real-life stories, including their personal experiences and that of illustrious people, most of whom are least heard of and had stayed away from the proverbial limelight. </p>

                <p>Take any relationship- be it between a parent and one's kids, that with one's friends, or colleagues etc., Any contact between two humans has got lot of intricacies and nuances. But nothing can beat the complexity more than a relationship that blossoms between a man and a woman who intends to share their life with each other. Given its complexity, capturing it in truest sense and realistically is quite a challenge for anyone as there is nothing black or white about 'Love', it's always in the grey!! The challenge lies in bringing out the inner emotions including the ambiguities and uncertainties in the minds of the characters who are portrayed to be in love. When it comes to authors, I always felt Somerset Maugham stands out in beautifully showcasing the vulnerabilities of the lovers. He goes to such depths so as to capture even the minutest of emotions in detail. For instance, his stories would narrate how stealthily they yearn to meet each other and verbalises the hard emotions that even the person undergoing them can't express in words</p>

                <p>Let's assume this situation. You are working in a reputed organization and your appraisal is underway. You have high hopes of getting a sizeable increment with a promotion to a leadership role. All of a sudden, your manager invites you into his room and asks you to poach some information to a competitor firm for some illegal commission. Would you be okay doing this so that your appraisal sails through, which will also keep you in your manager's good books or would you back off as you would be hurting the organization for illegal short term again. This is just an example of one of plethora of daily dilemmas that life throws at you with varying complexities. This book by Hardayal Singh, a civil service Officer, attempts to highlight through fictional and real stories of common men, that choosing and walking along the righteous path with an unwavering mind is possible but acknowledges that it is extremely difficult.</p>

                <p>The movie's storyline is very straight forward: How travel can change one's outlook about life. Of late, in Kollywood cinema, this pattern can be seen where there is a depressed person(men, mostly) who would climb on their Royal Enfield bike and then set off to the Himalayan mountains; when they return, they become a refined soul. So, is this movie any different from the stereotypical portrayal?! Ah, you can't get to the verdict right in the first paragraph :D</p>
